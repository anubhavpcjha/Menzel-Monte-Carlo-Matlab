## Readme

EstimationNFP.m evaluates the estimates using both MPEC and NFP. Code is being developed to exhibit the compuation time and 
statistical properties of the fixed point map.

# Subroutines


makeIndex.m computes the linear systematic part of random utilities allowing for several types of interaction effects.

Gale_Shapley.m finds one of the two extremal stable matchings using the deferred acceptance algorithm. 

loglik2.m computes the log-likelihood function for the matching market based on the limiting approximation

psi_fp1.m evaluates the fixed-point (equilibrium) condtion on the inclusive value functions. 

loglik3.m computes the log-likelihood function after solving the fixed point

psi_fp4.m is used to evaluate the fixed point of the inclusive value operator
